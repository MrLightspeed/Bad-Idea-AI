    "Long Description": "Baby Brick Inu serves as a 'Mutual Fund' within the Shibarium ecosystem, offering a unique 3-token reward system. When investors buy one token, they effectively receive three tokens in total, diversifying their Shibarium portfolio instantly.

Baby Brick Inu has locked 25% of its supply, which not only adds a layer of security but also acts as a token 'burn' mechanism. This locked wallet accrues both Brick by Brick Tokens and $BONE tokens, effectively reducing their overall supplies.
