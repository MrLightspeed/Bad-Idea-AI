It distinguishes itself with its humorous and competitive language, notably claiming superiority over other animal-themed tokens. It uses metaphors like making 'frog soup,' signifying its dominance in the crypto 'animal kingdom.' The $TOAD token reflects this spirit, with a total supply of 420,690,000,000,000. Its tokenomics are crafted to encourage participation and growth: 90% of the tokens are available for trading on Uniswap, and the remaining 10% are kept in the project's wallet. The initial liquidity was set with 10 ETH. Significantly, the liquidity provider (LP) token has been burnt to promote transparency and trust in the project's management. Additionally, the project maintains strong connections with the Shibarium community.",
