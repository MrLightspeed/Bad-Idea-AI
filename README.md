## Introduction
[Bad Idea AI](https://badidea.ai) is a blockchain-based project that aims to combine Blockchain, AI, and DAOs in a risky, meme-worthy concoction. It's an ERC20 token leveraging the power of Solidity and smart contracts.

## Why Bad Idea AI?
This project serves a unique purpose in the intersection of AI, blockchain, and social experiments. It is designed to test whether AI can work alongside humans to lead society into a new golden age or result in a dystopian future.

## Solidity Code Safety
The safety of our Solidity code is paramount. The contract is built using OpenZeppelin's secure and community-reviewed smart contract libraries. Additionally, the code has been audited by [Certik](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/bad-idea) and aced 73 of 73 properties with one informational note about large numbers. For more details, you can view the audit report [here](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/bad-idea).
